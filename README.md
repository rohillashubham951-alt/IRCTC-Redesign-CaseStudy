## IRCTC Website Redesign: UI/UX Case Study & Data Analysis

This case study focuses on analyzing and redesigning the IRCTC railway booking website to enhance user experience and streamline ticket booking. By identifying inefficiencies in the current user flow and navigation, conducting user-centric research, and proposing a modernized interface with improved data structures, this project aims to demonstrate the impact of thoughtful design in solving real-world problems.

## Current System Audit & Pain Points

The main challenges faced by users when using the IRCTC website or mobile application include:

- **System Unreliability and Downtime**
  - Frequent website/app crashes and outages during peak booking hours (Tatkal, festivals)
  - Slow loading times and sluggishness, leading to booking failure

- **Cluttered and Confusing User Interface**
  - Interface is crowded with information and advertisements, poor visual hierarchy
  - Railway jargon and abbreviations (WL, RAC, CNF, RLWL) lack explanations

- **Difficult Booking Flow**
  - Ticket booking journey is long and disjointed, increasing chance of user drop-off
  - Differences between booking options ('Plan your Journey', 'Quick Book') unclear

- **Login and Technical Glitches**
  - Login errors (incorrect credentials, invalid CAPTCHA, cache issues) slow recovery
  - Account recovery (forgot username/password) is complicated

- **Payment Failures and Confirmation Anxiety**
  - Frequent payment failures; uncertainty if tickets were booked after payment
  - Unclear booking confirmation increases anxiety

- **Lack of Essential Features/Usability**
  - Cannot book round trips in one transaction; repetitive processes
  - Difficulty in saving/managing passenger details for frequent bookings
  - Error messages often unclear or placed away from the area of concern
