## IRCTC Website Redesign: UI/UX Case Study & Data Analysis

This case study focuses on analyzing and redesigning the IRCTC railway booking website to enhance user experience and streamline ticket booking. By identifying inefficiencies in the current user flow and navigation, conducting user-centric research, and proposing a modernized interface with improved data structures, this project aims to demonstrate the impact of thoughtful design in solving real-world problems.

## Current System Audit & Pain Points

The main challenges faced by users when using the IRCTC website or mobile application include:

- **System Unreliability and Downtime**
  - Frequent website/app crashes and outages during peak booking hours (Tatkal, festivals)
  - Slow loading times and sluggishness, leading to booking failure

- **Cluttered and Confusing User Interface**
  - Interface is crowded with information and advertisements, poor visual hierarchy
  - Railway jargon and abbreviations (WL, RAC, CNF, RLWL) lack explanations

- **Difficult Booking Flow**
  - Ticket booking journey is long and disjointed, increasing chance of user drop-off
  - Differences between booking options ('Plan your Journey', 'Quick Book') unclear

- **Login and Technical Glitches**
  - Login errors (incorrect credentials, invalid CAPTCHA, cache issues) slow recovery
  - Account recovery (forgot username/password) is complicated

- **Payment Failures and Confirmation Anxiety**
  - Frequent payment failures; uncertainty if tickets were booked after payment
  - Unclear booking confirmation increases anxiety

- **Lack of Essential Features/Usability**
  - Cannot book round trips in one transaction; repetitive processes
  - Difficulty in saving/managing passenger details for frequent bookings
  - Error messages often unclear or placed away from the area of concern

## Problem Statement

The current IRCTC platform struggles to deliver a smooth booking experience due to unreliable performance, confusing navigation, and outdated interface design. These issues result in user frustration, failed bookings, and an overall lack of trust in the digital ticketing experience.

## Design Goals

- Simplify the end-to-end booking journey into intuitive, minimal steps.
- Reduce cognitive load by organizing information and removing clutter.
- Use clear language and visual hierarchy to make terminology understandable.
- Ensure reliability and trust through clean design, fast response, and clear feedback systems.
- Introduce accessibility and responsiveness to make the platform mobile-friendly.

## User Research & Data Analysis

To inform the redesign, I simulated a user survey within my college groups (n=30), on booking experience:

- 80% found the current homepage cluttered and confusing.
- 65% had trouble understanding IRCTC terminology (WL, RAC, CNF, RLWL).
- 50% reported booking failures due to technical issues.
- 60% wanted an easier way to save/manage passenger details and payments.
- Nearly everyone suggested a want to look at a cleaner and less-cluttered application layout.

**Analysis:**  
Users primarily struggled with navigation, clarity, and reliability—validating my focus on streamlining flows, improving language, and making technical upgrades.

## Wireframes

Based on user research and design goals, I created high-fidelity wireframes in Figma for all major flows.

### IRCTC Login/Signup Page

## A/B Testing Plan
To see if my redesign actually improves the user experience, I would run an A/B test—showing half the users the old IRCTC website (“A”), and half the users my new design (“B”).

I’d then compare these results for each group:
- How quickly users could book a ticket
- How many errors or failed bookings happened
- How satisfied users felt after booking

If the new design leads to faster bookings, fewer errors, and happier users, it proves my redesign is successful.

## Future Scope

- Conduct live usability testing with participants
- Iterate design for improved accessibility and multilingual support
- Prepare interactive high-fidelity prototype for developer handoff

## Tools Used

- Figma (for wireframes and prototypes)
- Canva (for any charts or visuals)
- Markdown & GitHub (for documentation and project showcase)

## Conclusion

Through this case study, I analyzed the major challenges users face with the IRCTC booking experience and explored solutions through modern UI/UX principles. By combining user-focused research with clear design goals, I created a set of wireframes aimed at making ticket booking simpler, faster, and less stressful for millions of travelers.

This project strengthened my abilities in user research, interface design, and problem-solving. I’m excited to build on these skills and help improve digital experiences in the travel industry and beyond.

Thank you for viewing my work! I welcome any feedback or suggestions.
